### Rules

1. **Slide** — Use arrow keys or swipe to slide all tiles in one direction.
2. **Merge** — When two tiles with the **same number** collide, they merge into one tile with **double the value** (e.g. `2 + 2 = 4`, `4 + 4 = 8`).
3. **Spawn** — After every move, a new tile (`2` or `4`) appears on a random empty cell.
4. **Score** — Each merge adds the resulting tile's value to your score.
5. **Goal** — Create a tile with the value **2048** to win!
6. **Keep playing** — After reaching 2048, you can continue to push for an even higher score.

## ⚡ Power-Ups

You have **three special abilities** to use strategically. Each has a limited number of uses per game — spend them wisely.

### ↩ Undo (2 uses)

Revert the board to its state before your last move. Tiles slide back smoothly to their previous positions. Use it to recover from a costly mistake.

### ⇄ Swap (2 uses)

Exchange the positions of **any two tiles** on the board.

1. Activate swap mode (click button or press `X`).
2. Click/tap the **first tile** — it glows to confirm selection.
3. Click/tap the **second tile** — both tiles glow briefly, then swap positions.

> Tap the same tile again to deselect. Making a regular move cancels swap mode.

### ⊗ Remove (2 uses)

Destroy **any single tile** from the board with a crimson sparkle dissolve effect.

1. Activate remove mode (click button or press `B`).
2. Click/tap the tile you want to remove — it dissolves and is gone.

> Remove is only available when more than 2 tiles are on the board.

## 🏆 Goal

**Create the 2048 tile.** Merge smaller tiles together to build up to 2048. Once you reach it, you win! You can then choose to keep playing and push your score even higher.

---

## 💀 Game Over

The game ends when:

- The **board is full** (all 16 cells occupied), **and**
- **No adjacent tiles** share the same value (no possible merges left).

When no moves remain, it's game over. Hit **Play Again** to start fresh.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Build your highest-value tile in a **corner** and keep it there.
- Move in **one primary direction** as much as possible to stay organised.
- **Save power-ups** for tight spots — an undo, swap, or remove at the right moment can save a run.

## ✨ What Makes It Special

### 🌠 Space Theme

A fully immersive cosmic experience — animated star fields, drifting nebulae, and a rotating black hole in the background. Every tile tier has its own distinct color inspired by the galaxy.

### 🔊 Procedural Sound

All sounds are generated in real-time using the **Web Audio API** — no audio files. Every action has its own unique sound: tile slides, merges (with tier-based tones), spawns, undo, swap, remove, win, and game over.

### 🎆 Merge Animations

Tiles merge with space-themed shockwave and glow effects. Higher-value tiles trigger increasingly intense visual effects — particle bursts, pulsing rings, and color shifts that match the cosmic aesthetic.

### 🔴 Remove Effect

Removing a tile triggers crimson sparkle particles, dark ember trails, and an expanding red glow ring — a clean, professional dissolve effect with a matching whoosh sound.

### 📱 Fully Responsive

Plays seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Touch swipe controls, adaptive grid sizing, and optimized layouts for screens of all sizes.

### 💾 Local Storage

Your **best score** is saved automatically and persists across sessions.
